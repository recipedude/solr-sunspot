# Solr docker image for Sunspot GEM

This is a docker image based on the official [Solr docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr), solr:7.6-alpine  pre-configured with schema files to support the 
[sunspot gem](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot).

You have find the [docker image here](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/recipedude/solr-sunspot).

## Why

The [sunspot gem](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot) uses [it's own schema](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/blob/master/sunspot_solr/solr/solr/configsets/sunspot/conf/schema.xml) 
that is incompatible with the default provided in the official Solr docker image.

Refer to [Cannot reindex solr container](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/issues/916) for more information on this.

## Pre-configured core

This image pre-configures a ```development``` core that should be ready to use.

## Fixes to the schema for Solr 7 compatibility

Commented out the following:

```<defaultSearchField>text</defaultSearchField>```
> Setting defaultSearchField in schema not supported since Solr 7

and

```<solrQueryParser defaultOperator="AND"/>```

Setting default operator in schema (solrQueryParser/@defaultOperator) not supported in Solr 7
